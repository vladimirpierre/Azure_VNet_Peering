<h1>Azure VNet Peering</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>


<p>In this lab, I will connect two virtual machines in two separate virtual networks in Azure. In Task 1, I will start the project off by creating the Virtual Networks and the subnets for the network. In Tsk 2, I will then Configure the DNS settings in Azure Task. In task 3, I will establish the connection of the two networks using Global VNet Peering</p>

<h2>What is VNet Peering </h2>

<p>The traceroute command is used on Linux systems, and it is used to show how a host connects to a remote host or system on the network. It also displays the path and time the communication takes to reach the remote host. Similarly, on Windows systems, the tracert command can be used for the same purpose. </p>
