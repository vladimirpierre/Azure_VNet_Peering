<h1>Azure VNet Peering</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>


<p>In this lab, I will connect two virtual machines in two separate virtual networks in Azure. In Task 1, I will start the project off by creating the Virtual Networks and the subnets for the network. In Task 2, I will then Configure the DNS settings in Azure Task. In Task 3, I will establish the connection of the two networks using Global VNet Peering</p>

<h2>What is Azure VNet Peering </h2>

<p>Azure Virtual Network Peering (VNet) peering is a technique used to securely connect two or more virtual networks using Azures network infrastructure. This will allow a solid network communication with high-bandwidth and low-latency connections. Azure Vnet peering allows you to safely share resources such as virtual machine assets, disaster recovery management, and cross-region data replication.  </p>
